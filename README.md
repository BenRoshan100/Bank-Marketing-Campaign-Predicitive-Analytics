## Overview
I'm a Data Analyst of XYZ consultancy Ltd. The ABC Portugal Bank approached our service and requested us to create a classfication algorithm to automatically place their prospective leads on having a term deposit in their bank. We will be creating a classification algorithm and also suggest them the insights we derive from this dataset and also help them to narrow down their leads into marketing funnel and in the end make a term deposit.

## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? I was getting bored working on just analyzing the data and fitting the data into the model without preprocessing the data. I explored on how to improve the model accuracy and stumbled upon feature engineering. It was such a precious concept where I explored alot on preprocessing data. Here I have implemented what I've learnt from blogs and youtube tutorials.

## Objectives of project
1. Meet and Greet Data
2. Prepare the Data for consumption (Feature Engineering and Selection)
3. Perform Exploratory Analysis (Visualizations)
4. Model the Data using Machine Learning
5. Validate and implement data model
6. Optimize and Strategize recommendations
